# Getting Started

## Installing MICM locally
To build and install MICM locally, you must have the following libraries installed:

- [sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx)
- [sphinx-book-theme](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme)
- [sphinx-design](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-design)
- [breathe](https://github.com/breathe-doc/breathe)

You must also have CMake installed on your machine. 

Open a terminal window, navigate to a folder where you would like the MICM files to exist,
and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/micm.git
cd micm
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..
sudo make install -j 8
```

To run the tests:

```
make test
```

If you would later like to uninstall MICM, you can run
`sudo make uninstall` from the `build/` directory.

## Running a MICM Docker container

You must have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running. With Docker Desktop running, open a terminal window and run the following command to start the MICM container:

```
docker run -it ghcr.io/ncar/micm:release bash
```

Inside the container, you can run the MICM tests from the `/build/` folder:

```
cd /build/
make test
```
