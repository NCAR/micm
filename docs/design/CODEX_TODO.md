- Add a guard/assert for calling `ConstraintSet::SubtractJacobianTerms` before `SetJacobianFlatIds`, and add unit tests to cover the failure path.
- Extend `EquilibriumConstraint` to handle zero/negative concentrations or enforce integer-only stoichiometry, and add edge-case unit tests.
- Patch DAE solver loop to recompute constraint Jacobian terms on rejected steps (in-place LU path) and add coverage.
- Decide and implement algebraic-variable error scaling (dedicated tolerances or exclusion), with tests for step-size control.
- Make constraint cloning explicit in `SolverBuilder` (error or virtual clone) to avoid silent drops of non-EquilibriumConstraint types.
- Define/validate behavior when `SetConstraintCount` is used without `SetConstraints` (reject or auto-create placeholders) and test it.
- Review DAE tests that currently require manual projection; decide whether to keep projection or move enforcement into solver.
- Identify which DAE integration/unit tests should live in PR parts 2/3 and document the split.
