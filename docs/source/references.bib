  abstract = {The Kinetic PreProcessor KPP was extended to generate the building blocks needed for the direct and adjoint sensitivity analysis of chemical kinetic systems. An overview of the theoretical aspects of sensitivity calculations and a discussion of the KPP software tools is presented in the companion paper. In this work the correctness and efficiency of the KPP generated code for direct and adjoint sensitivity studies are analyzed through an extensive set of numerical experiments. Direct-decoupled Rosenbrock methods are shown to be cost-effective for providing sensitivities at low and medium accuracies. A validation of the discrete\textendash adjoint evaluated gradients is performed against the finite difference estimates. The accuracy of the adjoint gradients is measured using a reference gradient value obtained with a standard direct-decoupled method. The accuracy is studied for both constant step size and variable step size integration of the forward/adjoint model and the consistency between the discrete and continuous adjoint models is analyzed. Applications of the KPP-1.2 software package to direct and adjoint sensitivity studies, variational data assimilation, and parameter identification are considered for the comprehensive chemical mechanism SAPRC-99.},

  abstract = {The kinetic preprocessor (KPP) is a software tool that assists the computer simulation of chemical kinetic systems. The concentrations of a chemical system evolve in time according to the differential law of mass action kinetics. A computer simulation requires the implementation of the differential system and its numerical integration in time. KPP translates a specification of the chemical mechanism into fortran or c simulation code that implement the concentration time derivative function and its Jacobian, together with a suitable numerical integration scheme. Sparsity in Jacobian is carefully exploited in order to obtain computational efficiency. KPP incorporates a library with several widely used atmospheric chemistry mechanisms and users can add their own chemical mechanisms to the library. KPP also includes a comprehensive suite of stiff numerical integrators. The KPP development environment is designed in a modular fashion and allows for rapid prototyping of new chemical kinetic schemes as well as new numerical integration methods.},

  abstract = {A new chemical kinetics mechanism for simulating urban and regional photochemistry has been developed and evaluated. The mechanism, called the Carbon Bond Mechanism IV (CBM-IV), was derived by condensing a detailed mechanism that included the most recent kinetic, mechanistic, and photolytic information. The CBM-IV contains extensive improvements to earlier carbon bond mechanisms in the chemical representations of aromatics, biogenic hydrocarbons, peroxyacetyl nitrates, and formaldehyde. The performance of the CBM-IV was evaluated against data from 170 experiments conducted in three different smog chambers. These experiments included NOx-air irradiations of individual organic compounds as well as a number of simple and complex organic mixtures. The results of the evaluation indicate substantial improvement in the ability of the CBM-IV to simulate aromatic and isoprene systems with average overcalculation of ozone concentrations of 1\% for the aromatic simulations and 6\% for the isoprene simulations. The mechanism also performed well in simulating organic mixture experiments. Maximum ozone concentrations calculated for 68 of these experiments were approximately 2\% greater than the observed values while formaldehyde values were low by 9\%.},

Math., No. 85) and compare eight solvers on a set of seven box-models used in present day models. The focus is on Rosenbrock solvers. These turn out to be very well suited for our application when they are provided with highly efficient sparse matrix techniques to economize on the linear algebra. Two of the Rosenbrock solvers tested are from the literature, viz. rodas and Ros4, and two are new and specially developed for air quality applications, viz. rodas3 and ros3.},

  abstract = {In many applications of atmospheric transport-chemistry problems, a major task is the numerical integration of the stiff systems of ordinary differential equations describing the chemical transformations. This paper presents a comprehensive numerical comparison between five dedicated explicit and four implicit solvers for a set of seven benchmark problems from actual applications. The implicit solvers use sparse matrix techniques to economize on the numerical linear algebra overhead. As a result they are often more efficient than the dedicated explicit ones, particularly when approximately two or more figures of accuracy are required. In most test cases, sparse RODAs, a Rosenbrock solver, came out as most competitive in the 1\% error region. Of the dedicated explicit solvers, TWOSTEP came out as best. When less than 1\% accuracy is aimed at, this solver performs very efficiently for tropospheric gas-phase problems. However, like all other dedicated explicit solvers, it cannot efficiently deal with gas-liquid phase chemistry. The results presented may constitute a guide for atmospheric modelers to select a suitable integrator based on the type and dimension of their chemical mechanism and on the desired level of accuracy. Furthermore, we would like to consider this paper an open invitation for other groups to add new representative test problems to those described here and to benchmark their numerical algorithms in our standard computational environment.},

  abstract = {The analysis of comprehensive chemical reactions mechanisms, parameter estimation techniques, and variational chemical data assimilation applications require the development of efficient sensitivity methods for chemical kinetics systems. The new release (KPP-1.2) of the kinetic preprocessor (KPP) contains software tools that facilitate direct and adjoint sensitivity analysis. The direct-decoupled method, built using BDF formulas, has been the method of choice for direct sensitivity studies. In this work, we extend the direct-decoupled approach to Rosenbrock stiff integration methods. The need for Jacobian derivatives prevented Rosenbrock methods to be used extensively in direct sensitivity calculations; however, the new automatic and symbolic differentiation technologies make the computation of these derivatives feasible. The direct-decoupled method is known to be efficient for computing the sensitivities of a large number of output parameters with respect to a small number of input parameters. The adjoint modeling is presented as an efficient tool to evaluate the sensitivity of a scalar response function with respect to the initial conditions and model parameters. In addition, sensitivity with respect to time-dependent model parameters may be obtained through a single backward integration of the adjoint model. KPP software may be used to completely generate the continuous and discrete adjoint models taking full advantage of the sparsity of the chemical mechanism. Flexible direct-decoupled and adjoint sensitivity code implementations are achieved with minimal user intervention. In a companion paper, we present an extensive set of numerical experiments that validate the KPP software tools for several direct/adjoint sensitivity applications, and demonstrate the efficiency of KPP-generated sensitivity code implementations.},
