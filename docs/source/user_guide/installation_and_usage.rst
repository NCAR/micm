Installation and usage
======================

This tutorial is going to focus **only** and how to install micm and/or include it 
into your project in multiple different ways. Any API specific details will be elided and will be covered 
in another tutorial.


Github codespace
----------------

If you want to play around with micm without figuring out how to include it in your local setup, this is the **easiest** 
option. Github codespaces offers a cloud-hosted version of Visual Studio Code configured to work with specific projects.
We've set one up for micm. It'll allow you to instantly run the tests and make changes. Please note that there is a cap on
the number of hours 


From an archive
---------------

All versions of micm are associated with a github `release <https://github.com/NCAR/micm/releases>`_. 
Each release includes a tarall and zip that you can use to grab the code.
